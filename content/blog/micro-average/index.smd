#### F1 Score

F1 Score is harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.

![F1 Score](precision_recall.png)

#### Precision

It tells you how weak is your model in predicting positive Classes. If number of False Positives are more than True Positives then your model has less precision.

#### Recall

It tells you how weak is your model in covering True Classes. If number of False Negatives are more than True Positives then your model has less recall.

- F1-Score can be easily calculated for a binary classification Problem.
- What if we have multi-class classification ? How can we calculate F1-Score and if calculated for each label how can we merge / consolidate them ?

Let's try to address these questions by considering an Example:

We have a dataset of 3 Labels Cat, Dog and Fish. We have built a multi-class classifier that predicts one label among these 3 labels and let's consider below as the the outputs for each Label. (One vs All)

The above values can be represented as below confusion Matrix:

![Confusion Matrix](confusion matrix.png)

From the above table we can deduce the following for each Label:
```
| Animals | TP  | FP  | FN  |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cat     | 10  | 15  | 13  |
| Dog     | 20  | 11  | 12  |
| Fish    | 13  | 12  | 13  |
```
Now F-1 Score for each label can be calculated by calculating individual Precisions and Recalls by

Precision = T.P / (T.P + F.P)
Recall = T.P / (T.P + F.N)

Ex: For Cat we have the following:
Precision = 10 / (10+15) = 0.4
Recall = 10 / (10+13) = 0.43

Therefore F1-Score for **Cat is 0.414**

Similarly F1-Scores for other labels are **Dog: 0.635, Fish: 0.51**

We acheived F1 Scores for independent Labels. How can we aggregate these F1-Scores into a single F1-Score for evaluating the Model ?

We have two type of Aggregations:
**Macro Averaged F1-Score and Micro-Averaged F1-Score**

#### Macro Averaged F1-Score

Here we simple average all the F1-Scores and calculate a mean F1-Score.

Average of all the F1-Scores result in **0.52**

But simply averaging all the F1-Scores isn't a fair way to estimate a model perfomance. Because this metric doesn't perform good on imbalanced dataset. A good explaination on the same can be [found here](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/15989/micro-average-vs-macro-average-performance-in-a-multiclass-classification-settin)

#### Micro Averaged F1-Score

Here instead of calculating each label's F1-Score, we derive the F1-Score by calculating Precision and Recall by summing all the TPs and Type Errors instead of calculating for each Label:

```bash
Total T.Ps = 10+20+13 = 43
Total F.Ps = 15+11+12 = 38
Total F.Ns = 13+12+13 = 39

Precision = 43/(43+38) = 0.53
Recall = 0.524

F1-Score = 0.526
```

Micro Averaged f1 score is one of the metric to be used for validation of multi-class classifier.

Scikitlearn offers computation of micro average f1 score on the fly through the function [`sklearn.metrics.f1_score`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html)
